\section{Introduction}
Since its outbreak in late 2019 in Wuhan, China the COVID-19 virus has spread all over the world and has challenged the social and health systems of many countries. 
The pandemic has also triggered a huge interest from all disciplines of science and countless researchers have contributed to the better understanding of the characteristics of this novel disease. 
An astonishing number of more than 29000 COVID-19 related contributions is available on the \href{https://search.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/}{WHO website} and all of these articles where published after the first of January 2020.

Those contributions cover an extremely wide range of aspects of the pandemic: from the behavior of the virus on a microscopic level and it's lifespan on different surfaces to the impact of the lockdown on the psychology of the population. 
One very important aspect of the pandemic is obviously the understanding of it's evolutions and consequently it's modeling and forecasting. Modeling is very important because it is the only way for decision-makers to implement the right policies at the right time. A robust model can help to choose what kind of measures to implement, like school closing or travel ban and also when to stop these measures.

The goal of this work is to explore the usage of data-driven system identification tool for COVID-related data. 
The most common way of modeling a disease is through compartmental models. They divide the population into different compartments like susceptible (not yet infected by the disease), exposed (infected but not yet infectious), infected, recovered. 
The interaction processes between the different compartments are governed by a set of simple ODEs. 
This framework was introduced almost a century ago and is flexible enough to model most of the effects and controls of the disease. The classic epidemiological approaches will be further introduced in section \ref{sec:class}.

In this work we deliberately choose to not use these  classic models and concentrate on the identification of dynamic processes in the evolution of the disease with very little a priori.
The different approaches considered in this work all gravitate around an algorithm proposed in \cite{sindy} called {\em system identification of nonlinear dynamics}. 
The details about this methodology will be explained in section \ref{sec:sindy}. 
In a few words, this algorithm allows to identify the dynamics from observed data through a sparse regression and based on a user-defined library of candidate functions. 
Throughout this work, we will use this algorithm in combination with datasets collected from different sources in order to better understand both the dynamics of the pandemic and the specificities as well as the limits of this algorithm. 

We deliberately limit ourselves to this algorithm and 

\section{Classic modeling methods}\label{sec:class}

It was briefly mentioned in the introduction that the most classic way of modeling an infectious disease is based on dividing the population into compartments. The most basic model of this kind is the SIR model that tracks the number of susceptible, infected and recovered people in the sample. It was originally proposed in \cite{sir} and has become the most widely used epidemiological model \com{discussion about micro and macro levels}. This very simple model is formulated by the following set of equations:

\begin{align*}
\dot{S} = &- \beta SI \\
\dot{I} = &\beta SI - \gamma I \\
\dot{R} = & \gamma I
\end{align*}

where $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are the parameters of the disease. $\sfrac{1}{\gamma}$ is the time a person remains infectious while $\beta$ quantifies the infectiousness of the disease. The ratio $\sfrac{\beta}{\gamma}$ is usually denoted $R_0$ and called the basic reproduction value. It is a very important characteristic of the disease because it represents the average number of people a single person is susceptible to infect. All the measures introduced by the governments in order to limit the impact of the disease were targeted at reducing this $R_0$ value. 

These models can be further elaborated in several ways. The first sophistication can be introduced by adding additional compartments like {\em exposed, quarantined, hospitalized, deceased} to further mimic the real interactions between these different categories of the population. It is clear that COVID-19 has a lot of delay in it's dynamics \cite{delay} because it can have an incubation time of up to two weeks. 
In order to take this into account it might be necessary to add at least an "exposed" compartment. Thus, when infected, a person is not immediately infectious and must stay a few days in the "exposed" compartment. 
A few examples of more sophisticated SIR models and adapted specifically to COVID-19 can be seen in \cite{seir} but as mentioned earlier there is a huge number of such adaptations.


Secondly, knowing that the different age groups of the population are affected in very different ways by the disease \cite{agegroups}, it might be interesting to subdivide the population into the relevant age groups in order to have a more precise control over the parameters. For example the mortality rate is almost equal to 0 for children and is very high for the people above 80 years of age. Age subdivision is also a widely used practice and can be seen in \cite{age} just to name a few.

Thirdly, one very classic way of making the models more complex and precise is by subdividing the region of interest into smaller sub-regions and to have a state for each of these sub-regions. For example a country can be sub-divided into regions or counties. Some parameters traducing the migrations between these regions can be introduced. One can imagine that this kind of modeling can be very useful for policy-makers to adopt more precise and local measures. Few examples of such models can be found in \cite{spatial}. These models are usually called {\em spatial SIRs}. 

Finally, there is no limitation to the complexity of the models that can be built on the basis of the SIR models. The can be combined and adapted to a very wide range of problems. SAn example of such use might include adding the relevant compartments to model the usage of a tracking mobile app that facilitates the isolation of people who have interacted with another infected person.

\subsection{Other modeling techniques}

The modeling of infectious diseases is however not limited to the aforementioned compartmental models and lots of different approaches from different disciplines exist. Other approaches for modeling the spread of an infectious disease include:

\begin{itemize}

\item Statistical models are more inclined towards capturing the random nature of the infectious diseases. Thorough reviews of these approaches can be found in \cite{}.

\item Gravity models can be used as standalone models or in conjunction with the compartmental approach and are called "gravity" models because they rely on considering the effect of distance and the size of donor and recipient communities \cite{}. 

\item Network-based models are built on the assumption that the spread of human disease follows its specified contact or spreading paths such as transportation or social contact networks \cite{}.

\item Agent-based models are based on the belief that individuals and their mutual differences are the key to understanding the spread of an infection \cite{}.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, hybrid approaches combining different methods are considered in the literature \cite{} as well as more computationally-oriented methods like cellular automata \cite{}. A thorough review about the modeling of infectious diseases can be found in \cite{}.

\section{Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics}\label{sec:sindy}

In this section the central algorithm used in this work will be introduced. This algorithm lies on the crossroads between dynamic modeling and machine learning. On one hand this algorithms is able to fit the observed data much like more classic machine learning algorithms would do. And on the other hand it does so by finding governing ODEs in observed data. In theory this allows to model an arbitrarily complex phenomenon while having the interpretability of a set of simple ODEs. We will see that in practice, when dealing with real-world data and complex problems this technique doesn't hold up to these expectations.

Machine learning is an extremely young branch of science as opposed to dynamic modeling, because mathematicians, physicists and engineers have been modeling physical phenomena for centuries. The shift that happened in the recent years is that (1) computational power has significantly increased and now allows for computations of unprecedented complexity and (2) observation data is getting increasingly available as sensor prices go down. The combination of these two tendencies opens new horizons for modeling increasingly complex processes.  


It was quickly mentioned in the introduction that this algorithm has two key features: (1) it relies on a user defined set of candidate functions and the result will only be as good as the candidate functions are with respect to the problem; (2) it uses sparse regression (some weights are gradually zeroed-out) in order to find the most parsimonious formula that still fits the data.

The whole methodology to discover the dynamics can be divided into 3 steps. Let's say that we have a series of observations $(\mathbf{x}(t_1), \mathbf{x}(t_2), \dots, \mathbf{x}(t_m))$ where $\mathbf{x}$ is the state or the vector state of the system of interest and $m$ is the number of observations. Our goal is to find a function $f$ such that:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:diff}
\dot{\mathbf{x}} = f(\mathbf{x})
\end{equation}



\begin{enumerate}
	\item It is more convenient to work with matrices to do the computations so our first step will be to divide the available data into two matrices:
	$$X = 
	\begin{bmatrix}
	\mathbf{x}(t_1) \\
	\mathbf{x}(t_2) \\
	\vdots \\
	\mathbf{x}(t_m)
	\end{bmatrix}
	\text{ and }
	\dot{X} =
	\begin{bmatrix}
	\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t_1) \\
	\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t_2) \\
	\vdots \\
	\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t_m)
	\end{bmatrix}
	$$

	here the dot notation denotes the time-derivative and it can be either directly observed or computed numerically.

	\item The second step of this algorithm is the augmentation of the state with the candidate functions. Let's say that we have a set of $p$ candidate functions ($f_1, f_2, \dots, f_p$) that we want to use for this identification. What we need to do is to construct a matrix $\theta(X)$:
	$$\theta(X) = 
	\begin{bmatrix}
	f_1(\mathbf{x}(t_1)) & f_2(\mathbf{x}(t_1)) & \cdots & f_p(\mathbf{x}(t_1))\\
	f_1(\mathbf{x}(t_2)) & f_2(\mathbf{x}(t_2)) & \cdots & f_p(\mathbf{x}(t_2))\\
	\vdots & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots\\
	f_1(\mathbf{x}(t_m)) & f_2(\mathbf{x}(t_m)) & \cdots & f_p(\mathbf{x}(t_m))\\
	\end{bmatrix}
	$$

	\item Finally we can run the optimization and find the best set of $\xi_1, \xi_2, \dots, \xi_p$ that minimize the following equation in the least squares sense:
	$$\dot{X} = \theta(X) \times \Xi \text{ where } \Xi = 
	\begin{bmatrix}
	\xi_1 \\
	\xi_2 \\
	\vdots \\
	\xi_p
	\end{bmatrix}
	$$
	After the best $\xi_1, \xi_2, \dots, \xi_p$ were identified, the very small $\xi$ (those that are under a certain threshold called {\em cutoff value}) can be removed from the equation alongside with the candidate function they correspond to. And then the least squares minimization can be ran again with the new subset of candidate functions and weights. After doing this thresholding a few times the algorithm converges.

\end{enumerate}

This is the very general definition of the algorithm, in our case we used almost exclusively polynomial terms of the state as candidate functions. For example in our state is $\mathbf{x} = (s, i, r)$ like in the compartmental models, then our candidate function be: 
$\mathbf{x} \mapsto 1,
\mathbf{x} \mapsto s,
\mathbf{x} \mapsto i,
\mathbf{x} \mapsto r,
\mathbf{x} \mapsto s^2,
\mathbf{x} \mapsto si,
\mathbf{x} \mapsto sr,
\dots,
\mathbf{x} \mapsto r^n$ where $n$ is the maximum degree of the polynomial terms that we consider. If the state of the system is $\mathbf{x} = x$ like if we just tracked the cumulative number of cases in a single country, then the candidate functions would be: $\mathbf{x} \mapsto 1,
\mathbf{x} \mapsto x,
\mathbf{x} \mapsto x^2,
\mathbf{x} \mapsto x^3,
\dots,
\mathbf{x} \mapsto x^n$. A more thorough discussion about polynomial terms is held in section \ref{sec:polynomials}.

Another remark is that this algorithm works equally well with an iterative formulation as it does with the differential one like in equation \ref{eq:diff}.
In this case we would have a series of observations ($\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \dots, \mathbf{x}_m$) and the goal is still the same but we want $f$ to express the dynamics in an iterative way:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:it}
\mathbf{x}_{t+1} = f(\mathbf{x}_t)
\end{equation}

This is slightly more convenient because it prevents us from numerically computing a derivative which obviously introduces some errors.


\section{Methodologies}

\section{Remarks}

\paragraph{Polynomial terms} 
In the original paper, the authors mostly use polynomial terms as candidate functions because the dynamics they identify in the examples are actually polynomial terms of the variables of the state. In the 7 examples of identification that they provide, the candidate functions always include the real dynamics. 

In our case we cannot guarantee the same thing. And instead we use polynomials as approximators and hope that they will be expressive enough to capture the evolution. Obviously, it is very important to make this distinction between making a library large enough to include the real dynamics and using polynomials as universal approximators.
