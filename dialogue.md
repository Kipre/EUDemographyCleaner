# Dialogue in NLP

__Cyprien NEVEROV - January 2020__

## Introduction

A _dialogue system_, or _conversational agent_ (CA), is a computer system intended to converse with a human. 
Dialogue systems employed one or more of text, speech, graphics, haptics, gestures, and other modes for communication on both the input and output channel.
The elements of a dialogue system are not defined, however they are different from chatbot. 
The typical GUI wizard engages in a sort of dialog, but it includes very few of the common dialogue system components, and dialog state is trivial.

The first dialogue systems have appeared in the late sixties, were very basic and used by the telecom companies to automate some simple interaction with the client. 
Nowadays dialogue systems heavily rely on machine learning techniques however they still need human assistance and configuration in order to function and to give plausible results.

But building a dialogue system of near-human intelligence would require to develop a near-human general AI which is not very likely to happen anytime soon. 
For now we can still continue to enhance all the different components that make a dialogue system in order to converge towards a good dialogue system.
