# Dialogue in NLP

__Cyprien NEVEROV - January 2020__

## Introduction

A _dialogue system_, or _conversational agent_ (CA), is a computer system intended to converse with a human. 
Dialogue systems employed one or more of text, speech, graphics and other modes for communication on both the input and output channel.

With the rising trend of artificial intelligence, more and more devices have incorporated goal-oriented spoken dialogue systems. 
Among popular virtual personal assistants, Microsoft’s Cortana, Apple’s Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Facebook’s M, have incorporated dialogue system modules in various devices, which allow users to speak naturally in order to finish tasks more efficiently. 
The traditional conversational systems have rather complex and/or modular pipelines. 
The advance of deep learning technologies has recently risen the applications of neural models to dialogue modeling. 
Nevertheless, applying deep learning technologies for building robust and scalable dialogue systems is still a challenging task and an open research area as it requires deeper understanding of the classic pipelines as well as detailed knowledge on the benchmark of the models of the
prior work and the recent state-of-the-art work [1].

## Components

Basic components of a dialog system are:

1. automatic speech recognition (ASR); 
2. language understanding (LU);
3. dialogue management (DM);
4. natural language generation (NLG).
