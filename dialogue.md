# Dialogue in NLP

__Cyprien NEVEROV - January 2020__

## Introduction

A _dialogue system_, or _conversational agent_ (CA), is a computer system intended to converse with a human. 
Dialogue systems employed one or more of text, speech, graphics, haptics, gestures, and other modes for communication on both the input and output channel.
The elements of a dialogue system are not defined, however they are different from chatbot. The typical GUI wizard engages in a sort of dialog, but it includes very few of the common dialogue system components, and dialog state is trivial.
